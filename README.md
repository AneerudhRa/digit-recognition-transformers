# Digit Recognition Optimization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the optimization of digit recognition using advanced machine learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Our goal is to accurately recognize numbers from uploaded Excel files, utilizing cutting-edge techniques to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition:** Leverage CNN and ViT models for high-precision digit recognition.
- **User Uploads:** Users can upload Excel files, and our models will recognize the digits contained within.
- **Anvil UI:** Utilizes Anvil for a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the application.
- **AWS Lightsail Hosting:** The machine learning code is hosted on AWS Lightsail, ensuring reliable and scalable application performance.

## How It Works

1. **Upload:** Users upload an Excel file through the Anvil-based UI.
2. **Processing:** The backend, hosted on AWS Lightsail, processes the file using our optimized CNN and ViT models.
3. **Digit Recognition:** The models analyze the data to recognize and classify digits.
4. **Results:** Users receive the recognition results directly through the UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Models:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT).
- **UI Framework:** Anvil.
- **Hosting:** AWS Lightsail.
